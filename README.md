Home inventory system

Sometimes the best way to learn a new language is to develop a simple aplication
and solve the challenges along the way. This project builds a REST interface
in front of an sqlite db. 

There is way too much stuff in the house and this project helps me track and find
where things have been stored especially when they have been stored in boxes.
